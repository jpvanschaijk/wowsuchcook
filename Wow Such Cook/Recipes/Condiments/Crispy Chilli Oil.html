<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
<li>Deseed your chillies, it's fine to leave some in depending on how spicy you like it</li>
<li>Coursely grind you chillies in a food processor</li>
<li>Mix all of your dry ingredients in a heat proof bowl or pan</li>
<li>Fry your shallots until lightly browned and fragrant in the oil. Be careful to not leave them in too long as they will continue to brown and will become bitter if they are fried too long</li>
<li>Do the same with the garlic, these need to be slightly ligher in color and will turn bitter quicker than the shallots if fried too long.</li>
<li>Once your aromatics have been fried, heat the oil to 190 celcius and then dump over your dry ingedients and stir vigorously.</li>
<li>Allow to cool to room temperature before removing the star anise and black cardamom pods.</li>
<li>Ladle into your prefered containers and enjoy!</li>
