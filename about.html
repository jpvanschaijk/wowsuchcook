<h1>Hello, I’m Jur</h1>
<p class="intro">
I cook comforting food for real life — inspired by seasons, travel, and the joy of feeding people well.

<h2>Why I Cook</h2>
<p>
Good Food Club started as a place to document the meals I kept coming back to — the pastas,
weeknight staples, and simple desserts that feel generous without being complicated.
</p>
<p>
I believe good cooking should feel welcoming, flexible, and grounded in everyday life — not precious or intimidating.
