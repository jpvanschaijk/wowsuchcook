<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
<li>Deseed the vanilla pod and put this in a small sauce pan with the creme and heat it gently until it starts steaming.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, mix the sugar, salt and egg yolks in a bowl and whisk it untill pale and you can't see/feel any sugar crystals.</li>
<li>Once the cream is hot, slowly temper the egg yolk mixutre by slowly whisking in a steady stream of the cream mixture, after this transfer the custard to the serving containers.</li>
<li>Cook in a sousvide cooker for 1 hour at between 80-85C. The lower the temperature the softer and creamier the custard, the higher the temperature the more firm.</li>
<li>After cooking for 1 hour, remove form the cooker and allow to cool to roomtemperature before chilling in the fridge for atleast 4 hours, preferably overnight.</li>
<li>When serving, sprinkle a about a teaspoon's worth of white sugar on top of the custard before caramelizing it gently yet quickly with a torch. Allow the caramel to set before enjoying.</li>
